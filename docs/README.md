## Setting Up The Project Locally

- Fork the repo
- Clone the project
- Open the project, we suggest you either use Visual Studio Community Edition or Visual Studio Code (both free)
- You will need to ensure that you have the libaries containing mitigations for the Spectre exploit, information on how to install them may be found in the [installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/qspectre?view=vs-2017)

### Compiling

There are two build configurations available:

- Debug: Compile with all debugging symbols for development. Results in decreased performance and an inflated DLL
- Release: Compile in release mode

Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have build tasks set up for each of the above configurations.

### Running Tests

Tests are powered by Google Test and Google Mock and may be run by compiling and running the `UKControllerPluginTest` project.

Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code offer test runner adapters for GoogleTest, to integrate the running of tests
into the development environment.
